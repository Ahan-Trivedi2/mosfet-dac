### MAD VLSI: Miniproject 3

This project presents a seven-bit current-output digital-to-analog converter (DAC) implemented using a MOSFET-based R–2R-like ladder network in the SkyWater 130 nm CMOS (sky130pdk) process. Operating from a 1.8 V single-ended supply, the DAC converts seven digital inputs into an analog output current capable of sourcing or sinking with less than 0.5 %/V variation across at least 80 % of the supply range and minimal dependence on VDD. The design achieves differential and integral nonlinearities (DNL/INL) below 2 LSB and 4 LSB under nominal conditions, and within 8 LSB under mismatch as verified through Monte Carlo simulations in Ngspice. A single external resistor provides the bias current, and the design passes all DRC and LVS checks. Layout practices such as symmetry, dummy devices, and selective common-centroiding were used to minimize mismatch, and the architecture incorporates subcircuits including a bootstrap bias generator (BBG), forward-voltage follower (FVF), cascode current mirror (CCM), and current-steering output stage, inspired by Hammerschmied and Huang’s untrimmed 10-bit MOSFET DAC.
